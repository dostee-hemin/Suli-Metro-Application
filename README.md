Make sure you have Java downloaded. You can find a list of versions [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

To use the application, run the "Suli_Metro_Application.exe" file inside the main folder.

# How to use
You can search for specific well-known locations in the city using the search bars for point A and B.

You can also click on the pin icons for point A and B to set the locations at an exact point.

Once both points have been selected, the program will run and find the best path using the A-Star algorithm. You can toggle viewing the full metro route with the metro button on the lower left side.
